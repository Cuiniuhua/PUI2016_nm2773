### a) Verify null and alternative hypotheses.
Null and alternative hypotheses are both formulated correctly.
### b) Does the data support the project?
Since distance can be approximated from the start and stop locations and each ride has the associated birth year of the rider there is sufficient data for this analysis.  

Consider refining  your definition  of millennials  (e.g., the 15 years from 1979 - 1994). Including  16 year olds (born in 2000) is a different demographic (kids/youths) than you probably want. Also, instead of  using  the mean to distinguish between short and long trips it would be interesting to see how using the median would change your analysis. 

Note: It'd worthwhile to explain the limitation of your assumption that the start and stop location of each ride approximates ride distance. Different ages might be using citibike for different kinds of trips confounding your analysis. For example, the younger population might be using the service more to commute from Station A to Station B. Whereas  the older population might be using the service more for leisure (i.e., using a station near home  going for a long ride and returning it to the same station for a net distance of 0).
### c) Choose a statistical test.
Since you are comparing two groups (Milllenials & Others) along one dependent variable  (proportion of  long  trips to short trips) you could use a t-test for this analysis. 

Very cool question and work so far!
