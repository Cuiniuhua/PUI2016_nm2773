In this assignment, I used 5 distributions: normal, binomial, chi-square, poisson, geometric, all with mean = 100 to demonstrate central limit theorem.

## Assignment 2

I am working with Kaylyn and Xueqi in this assignment. We analyze the citibike data together. Xueqi formulizes the hypothesis in the math form, Kaylyn and I observe the data to get insights. We use `geopy` package, that is not included in anaconda, to calculate the distance. So it is **better to download the `geopy ` first**. 

I can not use `curl` and running the example code to download the data since I use windows, so we are using `urllib2`, `StringIO`, and `ZipFile` package to download, unzip, and open the data.
