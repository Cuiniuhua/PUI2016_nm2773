# HW 5

## Assignment 1
In this assignment, I compare the distribution of citibike ridership data from June 2016 with normal distribution (gaussian), gamma, and skewnorm. I did all by myself.

## Assignment 2
I use 2 type of linear regression: one with OLS from statmodels and the other one is the best analytical regression method as written in dr Federica's skeleton notebook. The first part (gather the data, scatter plot) I got help from Maisha and I did the rest all by myself (plot data, regression, compare regression, making predictions)

## Assignment 3
All the hypotheses are in file `HW5_Assignment3_nm2773.ipynb`
