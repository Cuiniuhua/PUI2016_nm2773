# HW 4
## Assignment 1
I forked the PUI repo `PUI2016_xz1845` and added `CitibikeReview_nm2773.md` inside `HW3_xz1845` folder to review my friend's work. I suggest t-test to his/her project.

## Assignment 2
I worked with Kaylyn and Claire in this assignment. Kaylyn find the article for t-test and Claire find the article with correlation. I involved in the discussion determining the variables and hypothesis.

Here are our findings:

| **Statistical Analyses	|  IV(s)  |  IV type(s) |  DV(s)  |  DV type(s)  |  Control Var | Control Var type  | Question to be answered | _H0_ | alpha | link to paper **| 
|:----------:|:----------|:------------|:-------------|:-------------|:------------|:------------- |:------------------|:----:|:-------:|:-------|
t-test	| 1, Types of Viruses | categorical | 1, % of light reflected | continuous | 1, healthy leaves | categorical | 	Do viruses affect the percentage polarization of light reflected from leaves.| Reflected light % before virus = Reflected light % after virus | 0.05; 0.001 | [The Effects of Plant Virus Infection on Polarization Reflection from Leaves](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152836) |
Correlation	| 2, olfactory abilities, executive brain functioning abilities | continuous | 1, correlation | continuous | 1, sub-clinical psychopathologies | categorical | 	How strongly correlated are the olfactory abilities and executive brain functioning abilities. | Olfactory abilities are weakly correlated to executive brain functioning abilities. | 0.01 | [Olfactory Impairment Is Correlated with Confabulation in Alcoholism](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0023190) |

In this assignment I help my teammates slicing the data for KS sampling per 200 and other tests. There are two observations: 

### 1. Female Age Distribution vs Male Age Distribution

Result: Null hypothesis rejected, they have similar distribution.

Method: KS test, Pearson's test, Spearman's test

### 2. Daytime Riders Age Distribution vs Nighttime Riders Age Distribution.

Result: Null hypothesis rejected, they have similar distribution.

Method: KS test
